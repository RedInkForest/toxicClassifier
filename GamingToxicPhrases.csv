"I feel like part of what makes that toxic is creativity, or if not creativity at least novelty - you haven't seen it before so you stop and read it. Whereas the normal gamer cliches (fk you cancer animal orphan or whatever) have been seen before so you don't really read them - you just process them as oh this person is mad at me. Even the person writing them probably believes on some level that they're merely expressing frustration with a teammate and nobody takes the literal words they're writing too seriously. ",Not Toxic
"Probably not the most toxic I've seen but it still sticks with me, I was at work and got a call from my brother to tell me my Nan had died (to cancer). I pretty much broke down and went home. ",Not Toxic

"t's been 12 long, torturous hours without MapleStory ????. My hands are trembling as I type this ????, desperate for some semblance of solace ????. The maintenance was supposed to end HOURS ago ???, but NO Nexon decided to extend it. AGAIN. ???? My life is in SHAMBLES. ???????

I woke up this morning ??, the first thought in my head being, ""Today's the day I grind that last level to hit 250! ????"" But no. MapleStory BETRAYED me ?????. I stared at the maintenance notice on the launcher ??? like a lost puppy ??, hoping, PRAYING ??? for it to change. Nothing. ??

I tried to distract myself ??. I watched videos ??, scrolled through social media ??, even tried to boot up another game ??. But NOTHING filled the void. NOTHING. ???? I keep hearing the Maple login screen music ???? in my head like a cruel echo of what I can't have ????. I went outside for the first time in weeks ???????, hoping fresh air would help ?????. It didn't. I ended up walking past trees imagining they were in Ellinia ???. I tried to explain the situation to my family ??, but they just DON'T understand. They NEVER do. ???? They said, ""It's just a game."" JUST A GAME???? MapleStory is more than that it's my SANCTUARY ???, my PURPOSE ??, my ENTIRE BEING ????.

MapleStory is my EVERYTHING ???. My link to sanity ????????, my escape from this cruel world ????. Without it, I'm ADRIFT, lost in a sea of despair ????. NEXON, if you can hear me ????, PLEASE end the maintenance ??????. I'm BEGGING YOU ???. Every second without Maple is a second closer to TOTAL EXISTENTIAL COLLAPSE. ??? Please I CAN'T take much more of this ??????.",Not Toxic

"as far as I can tell its just your brain getting tricked
all noise canceling does is emit soundwaves on the opposite length of what its receiving from the outside

"I  love when the leader of the VII killed one of the leaders of XX but actually we don't know and he could have been XX's leader's twin brother, but they swapped identities for the time being. Apparently XIII also killed the other twin brother but it could have been one of XX's legionaries in disguise since they all got plastic surgery to look like him.
Or it could be that both of the XX leaders are alive and fighting eachother, or both XX leaders could be loyal, or both could be traitors. Or both XX leaders could have died.",Not Toxic
"The fact that elderly actually have soft spot to autistic/people with mental disabilities also shocking, with how bad mental health is seen by older generation
You're pretty lucky to have such an understanding colleague",Not Toxic
"They are losing money
Every other Cygames game that is on the App Store (gbf isn't) is making 1/2 to 1/3 what they used to make
Like Uma is no longer constantly in top 10
Every big gacha got pushed down by HoYo
Even FGO is making just a fraction of what it used to
While the 3 big hoyo games and a few other big Chinese titles are taking top 5 spots regularly
So in that sense they're probably desperate for revenue
Gbf is also really old now and will naturally just bleed player",Not Toxic

"it's so weird, sometimes, upon using any teleport, they will only apply the new x and y coordinate, but keep the old z coordinate, so you will be at the same height, also once had it happen that I was below ground level after teleport",Not Toxic
"It is steady if the game doesnt lag or dc you
The old fishing system was more lag resistant than what we have now",Not Toxic
"undergyffin is shai friendly, all oluns instances are shai friendly but lets be honest here doluns 1 is trash, elvia trolls is good when you tryhard double rift and get 15k (lvl 2+ agris) trash with low ap, DSR you can grind average trash/h and is agris efficient, Turos dekia is pretty good since the cap isnt really high and you can overperform easily",Not Toxic
"but then some tards started lowering the prices of dawns
and yeah i agree it sucks now
dokkebi also sucks major ass",Toxic
"Some infos to reworked darkseeker. AP breakpoint is 949ap. Ap Cap 1150AP to 30% effectivity. Shai friendly as you fight 1 pack for longer. In first phase you can focus only 1 mob and the other one dies with it. 2nd phase: Dont move when the minions spawn and let them pile up before dashing behind them. All mobs hit really hard, but with shai hp pool it is not too bad. Other classes will struggle for sure. Mony per hour i wait for official release but doesnt look bad in my first impression.",Not Toxic
"at spots where you don't need to fill ap vs dr gap, about any class can outdo shai, was pulling 9k more at honglim with same loot buffs just using a tagged succ nova that I am not fully proficient with and pri storm devoured blackstar awakening and minimal consumable buffs",Not Toxic

something DR
like i like how awk musa feels but im not gonna swap to eva

"Potentially stupid question but does anyone know if the requirements for auto sprint on t10 horses has changed? I'm at artisan 9 for training, haven't played since the family-wide life skills unlock happened, but now I can't auto-sprint on my Big Shiny Horse anymore. Works fine on lower tier horses",Not Toxic
"hey if someone could help a newbie shai.. I was trying to learn reading here  the chat.. is this the correct way to grind doluns 2?
when msg appears, buff the 4 songs + healing + z + e
when it spawns, hold Q for 1 tick (if party is strong) or like 3 ticks (if lower gs)
then hit from behind (do I try killing the arms or just go to back and try not to kill it?)

I saw people focus the arm and after the iframe, then misty?",Not Toxic
"do we have like a lower base ap? I'm newbie yet on shai, but just checking if my total ap was right on garmoth.. (assuming I'd have a primoridial artina)
it seems my dosa has the same monster ap even though primordial would have more monster ap? and less species dmg ofc..
and yes, I'm not adding the 30/60ap we have from e+leaf",Not Toxic
Just because I don't use suns fury cancel doesn't mean I'm not being optimal. There are other ways of working with her kit like wgw to be optimal rather than trying to use suns fury cancel for 1 second of protection in a situation where you need to be protected instead of just proper positioning. Also suns fury cancel is not faster than from hotba,Not Toxic
i mean just from looking at warscores and nothing else id say u need to learn how to position better instead of trying to do some wgw tech,Not Toxic
Choice has been complaining for long on shai but lets be fair having shai mandatory for stuff like pvp or doluns and if one side doesnt have shai its auto lose is just bad mechanism from PA,Not Toxic
"They (grind zone devs) are zealous about the design of spots and making it difficult, challenging, and 'fun' but like in a painful way. I'm not sure if they wanted it to be equally rewarding because the conversation was short and the only thing they said was about how they have a crazy amount of future gear that may or may not ever be in game but is fun to 'stress test' spots vs the current and potential future of gear. 
To kno what I mean, think original Crypt, Ash, Dehkia Ash.
Things they hated: oluns, spooder cave
They said group grind spots are hard to balance cuz players can just be carried by their friends so they prefered solo spots.",Not Toxic
"I heard PA struggles cuz it is a revolving door for devs who struggle to be allowed to impliment any ideas as the scene is stiffled by an oligarchy of lead devs.
which is tragic if true and even more saddening if the bit about shai is true.
ofc as a shai player i think the style and design of the class was interesting. Choosing a boomerang was also pretty cool as it is a rarely used weapon. Kinda reminded me of link with the bomb shaped vitclari, it is just a shame how the class turned out.",Not Toxic
"The only change I really disagree with was the 33% BSR nerf. I also think he takes a lot of shit away from shai and is missing some compensation.
Also misty being a stacking buff with how slow and vulnerable it makes you will mean shais die before the 'ramp up' even matters.
They would have to return misty to like a 30s cd which would mean in some content shais would be spamming misty or stacking multiple shais",Not Toxic
"Problem is there are too many classes that are vastly different from each other and it's near impossible to balance them in PvE, let alone PvP without fully reworking everything
PA don't have it in them to do it, because they know the player base wouldn't be happy to see reworks to every class",Not Toxic
"Im just gonna wait and see whatever the fuck they do to shoi, if they do anything that is
Game lead designer could very well just be like : yeah nah I want Shai to be broken at group still
Divios only gave a suggestion, doesn't really mean that they will agree or do it in some capacity
My hope is a rework (unlikely but copium)",Not Toxic
"BDO community is way too unreasonable, especially pvper side more so, although PvE side can be just as awful
And lifeskillers is fine until u touch the more hardcore lifeskillers",Not Toxic
Yeah i see him eating more dirt than mike,Toxic
"it doesnt really fix the issue they want so much to be adressed
because to fix that you either have to fully rework the class, or kill it to the point no one plays it
either way this damn sheep dont understand it
we will see and wait
wouldnt be surprised if they just did some half assed changes",Not Toxic
" Other classes complain about the group pvp but shai just makes other classes more fun to play. The f buffs are for other classes, the misty lets you kill perma SA classes. How many times does the shai get the kill? Playing proper shai sucks a lot to play already as a buff/cc bot.
Everyone wants to nerf the class whos only role is to let other classes have more fun",Not Toxic
"I want to level trading to get more money from afk fishing. I have a bunch of wood just rotting in Calpheon, I moved it to Grana to process... Could I process it, make it into boxes and somehow ""powerlevel"" my trading level? I'm at Skilled 8 at the moment and I assume just getting to Artisan or Master 1 would help a lot.",Not Toxic
"whispers I refuse to take my trash crates across the Ocean and I walk them to Grana, myself.  I am aware I am losing XP that way, but, it's a sacrifice I choose to make.",Not Toxic
"we are 1 of the most active and vocal communities so they are not overly eager to rock our boat either
we have consistently been one of the loudest about unfair designs. ??
but I'd like to state that i also think we try hard and want to work with PA to have fun in bdo as a support",Not Toxic
"I'll be honost I did NOT have faith in divios cuz when i was in cho he made me feel a bit like he might be part of the jerks who just hate shai
However, in the months that followed and particularly right before he quit. I revisited him on issues since he was bringing up shai stuff and I wanted to know if he was gona be a srs issue not just a jerk. I was happy to hear that his understanding of the class had really evolved and a lot of what he said was not just one sided destruction but an understanding that I hadn't experienced before.
So, for now and until he gives me reason to hate on him. I'm gona grant him a bit of earned faith to say that he prob pitched our issue to the devs in a pretty good way.",Not Toxic
"I did. at the time I went full acc because I was like ""well, I already do so little damage (in pvp) so more AP seems meaningless, at least if I can make sure I hit them if they're eva I can do something to them"" 
this was when I was mostly doing open world pvp, hunting red karma players and arsha
but alas, the black robe is gone",Not Toxic

i could see nova still being best at some spot with even more movement needed but no spot like that is relevant anymore",Not Toxic
"wdym
atm kharazads are way easier and cheaper to enchant to oct

sure if you pen a debo u get IX
but kharazad at least provides some cushioning
and its not that expensive
like, yeah i spent like 45 b into my 6->7 attempt
but heck, thats just a bit higher than one hammer, or a tet debo",Not Toxic
"Literally all spots have been devalued massively with debos dropping in price. It's kinda sad as PA have effectively deleted massive amounts of silver out of the game with the new gear not being listable
Only 3 good spots in the game without agris are Doluns 2, tungrad and trolls",Not Toxic
I had a stroke reading that,Not Toxic
The striker is playing like he's having a stroke,Toxic
"Honestly it's just crazy how bad our AoE size is when I play most other classes it's like night and day. but Shai just feels so much better for me to play. I can never get bored of the class
Just find it funny how every guild wants Shais and PA are doing their hardest to delete the class by forgetting it exists",Not Toxic
"fuck PA
Stop shafting Shai FFS and give us some buffs rather than shadow nerfs",Toxic
